# LinkedList-Helper

This Python script defines classes and functions to create various types of linked lists (singly linked list, circular singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular doubly linked list) with minimum code. By importing this script into any Python file, you can easily create linked lists without writing extensive code for each type.

✔️ Functions to create different types of linked lists:
  
-👉 singly_linkedlist: Creates a singly linked list from an input array.
-👉 circular_singly_linkedlist: Creates a circular singly linked list from an input array.
-👉 doubly_linkedlist: Creates a doubly linked list from an input array.
-👉 circular_doubly_linkedlist: Creates a circular doubly linked list from an input array.
-👉 display_linkedlist function: This function displays the elements of a singly or doubly linked list by traversing through the linked list and printing the node values.
-👉 display_circular_linkedlist function: This function displays the elements of a circular linked list. It traverses through the circular linked list, printing the node values until it reaches the starting node again.

By using this script, you can quickly create different types of linked lists in your Python projects, making the code more modular and concise.
